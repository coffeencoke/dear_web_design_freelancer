# Dear Web Design Freelancer

To the designers who went freelance, and dove into programming with an emphasis on design and front end development.  This is for you.

This is a repository to support a series of blog posts at [Coffeencoke's Blog](https://coffeencoke.com).

My goal, is to produce several tutorials and building blocks to improve your workflow.  Who am I?  I am a senior software engineer, who loves a beautiful user experience, and appreciates what you do.  I just want to give you some tools, that you may, or may not, have had exposure to yet, and will improve your enjoyment of work -- hopefully :)

## Strategy

I wish to provide you with three examples for a series of topics.  If you commit yourself to learning these topics, I guarantee that you will improve your process, your product, and hopefully, your enjoyment. 

*Please realize that my day job emphasizes on very complex software development, but I have experience in design, UX / Front End development, and I will try to present these topics in a way that you can appreciate*

1. Introduction to Software Source Control - never lose a thing, hack away safely.
2. Develop Locally - keep production happy
3. Deploy With Ease - No more hacking around with production servers
4. Automate Your Deployments - Ship your work more efficiently
5. Control Your Quality - Develop in peace, demonstrate with flexibility, test before production, and be at peace.

These are my five topics thus far, if you have other topics that you wish to see, please let me know.
